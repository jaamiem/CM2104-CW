			<h3 class="pageh3">Our Vision</h2>
			<p class="pagep">Parking is one of the most difficult and dysfunctional parts of modern city life – and that’s no surprise, as it’s barely changed for decades.

	Over 23% of car journeys involve some kind of parking pain – that’s 190 million trips a month – with drivers suffering from both uncertainty (availability, prices, restrictions) and inconvenience (full car parks, slow payments, unfair fines) on a daily basis.

	Yet we have the technology to make parking function seamlessly – and so much space is lying underutilised. There has to be a better system…

	At FindSpot, we are on a mission to make parking easy.

	Findspot is dedicated to solving the parking problem by cracking both sides of the market – making parking easy and efficient for everyone.</p>
